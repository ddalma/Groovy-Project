# Groovy-Project
File System Application in Groovy 

#Information on the program:

The purpose of this program is to create a simple File System Automation program.
This program will simulate looking for files and outputting it's information,
as well as creating, editing and deleting files of your choosing. This program
was built using the programming language Apache Groovy, which is Java-Syntax-compatible, while having similar features to Python, Ruby, Perl, etc. 


How to run the program:

1. If the language/envrionment has not yet been installed, please refer to:
http://groovy-lang.org/install.html to download the necessary files for your machine.

2. Open a command prompt, for Mac users such as myself I used terminal, and cd into the folder or file where GroovyAccenture.groovy is placed (Mine was in a folder named Groovy Projects).

3. Once in the folder, in the terminal type 'groovy GroovyAccenture.groovy' to run the program, and follow the command prompts to tinker or use the application.
